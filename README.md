# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains various machine learning models and datasets used for training and evaluating different machine learning algorithms. The primary focus is on regression and classification techniques.


## Project Descriptions

### 1. **Datasets**
- **CarPrice.csv**: Dataset containing car features and their corresponding prices. Used for regression models to predict car prices.
- **Diabetes.csv**: Dataset containing medical records for patients, used for classification in predicting diabetes diagnosis.
- **Salary.csv**: Dataset containing employee salary details and factors affecting salaries.

### 2. **Notebooks**
- **KNN Classification.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook implementing K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm, focusing on predicting outcomes using the `Diabetes.csv` dataset.
  
- **Linear Regression.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook that demonstrates simple linear regression using the `Salary.csv` dataset to predict salaries based on various features.

- **Multiple Linear Regression.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook that applies multiple linear regression on the `CarPrice.csv` dataset to predict car prices based on multiple factors.

## Usage

To explore or execute the models, open the corresponding `.ipynb` notebooks in Jupyter or any other notebook environment. Make sure to have the required libraries installed, such as:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## How to Contribute

Feel free to submit issues or pull requests if you'd like to improve any of the models or add new ones.
